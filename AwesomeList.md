##Articles & Blog Posts
Most of the articles out there on personas are created for User Experience ('UX') and product owner consumption/usage. I encourage DevRel teams to step back and see that these same UX principles apply to the Developer Experience ('DX') that you are looking to build.

##Sample Personas
- [Segmenting Developers into Personas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liTCvhUCiIM) - they introduce six developer personas and how they use data and segmentation to create them. Their personas include the Young Learner, the Young Professional, the Emerging Extender, the Middle Standard, the Seasoned Decision Maker, and the Inexperienced Loner.
