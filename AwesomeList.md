There are a number of great resources available for personas.

## Articles & Blog Posts
Most of the articles out there on personas are created for User Experience ('UX') and product owner consumption/usage. I encourage DevRel teams to step back and see that these same UX principles apply to the Developer Experience ('DX') that you are looking to build.

### Persona Examples & Templates
Below are blog posts that include a number of examples of how to visually represent your personas. In my experience, having an easy 'who is this and how can I use it' is critical for gaining traction in your team and with your stakeholders. Most example collections that I've found are a pitch for the company's services or design offering, but still worth a trip through their petting zoo of examples:
