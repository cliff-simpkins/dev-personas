# Modern Developer Personas
This repository contains a collection of developer personas for use by developer marketing and DevRel teams, regardless of the company that they work at and portion of the global developer population that they target. They serve as 'short hand' to help organizations drive clarity of strategy and execution - breaking the large 'developer' population into distinct/named groups that can be prioritized and built for.

These personas are motivation-centric personas, prioritizing behaviors and motivations over job title or ecosystem-preference. The best way to think of how they differ is to place them along two axis - their inclination towards innovation (are they tech-led or solution-led) and how much decision making power do they have. They are also easy to extend and tailor to your particular organization's needs.

These developer personas have been crafted to help your teams...

- Align leadership and internal stakeholders teams on which developer segment you are building for, and what success measures each team is accountable for
- Align with Product and Product Marketing on value proposition, messaging, and GTM planning
- Align with Marketing Operations and Demand Gen to ensure developers are properly identified and treated appropriately
- Align with Sales to ensure developers are authentically engaged

Each persona includes standard dimensions such as motivations, technical profiling (and common job titles), common evaluation criteria, preferences, challenges, communication preferences, and learning styles to enable consistent application across organizations. To put them into action, I recommend [Developer Relations by Caroline Lewko and James Parton](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58153391-developer-relations), which demonstrates how to map it to a persona to your developer journey *(Discover -> Evaluate -> Learn -> Build -> Scale)*.

## Five Personas and How to Reach Them
Each of these included personas represent a type of developer you may engage. Below is an example of how a company's DevRel team may use to reach each persona.

## Persona Design Considerations

The personas have their root in my experience as a Product Manager at Microsoft - I've been working with personas for 15+ years, designing personas for Windows and Microsoft Azure and working with the UX team that managed personas for all of Microsoft's developer offerings. I could write a book on the lessons learned from Microsoft's decades of persona experience - learning more about differences of segments vs personas, too many vs too few, the importance of regional tailoring, and more (and - in fact - I wrote [a chapter on the topic of personas](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49385943-developer-marketing-and-relations)  :) ). 

These particular personas have their roots in an effort in 2017 to create base personas that are industry-wide, not just focused on one product/business. In 2019, my team built and tested a series of Cloud Developer personas (Conductor, Craftsman, Explorer, Artist, and Tactician) that we used with GTM strategy and content creation/testing. I even collaborated with several other platform providers on the idea of open-sourcing them. But the Pandemic came in and put this on the back-burner and I changed companies. The personas in this repository reflect a further evolution of those five, further expanding them and incorporating persona needs I felt running a DevRel team a SaaS provider.

### Designed for collaboration
Although built with the DevRel and developer marketing teams in mind, the personas are designed to be usable by DevRel stakeholder/partner teams - marketing, product, and field/sales. Each personas includes a professional profile section to aid with identification and measurement, as well as an 'engagement tactics by team' section that provides actionable guidance to DevRel stakeholders.

### Guiding principles for persona design

As these personas were built, I used the [DevRel Foundation working group requirements and use case list](https://github.com/DevRel-Foundation/wg-resource-aggregation/discussions/46), which carried the following requirements:
1. Outcome-focused - They can be used to inform and guide DevRel strategies and tactics
2. Motivations - They include both technical and emotional aspects of developers
3. Practical - They incorporate industry-standard dimensions for practical use
4. Use cases - Each persona can drive content creation, event planning, community building, and product feedback
5. FLEXIBLE - They remain flexible enough to be adapted for specific contexts
