# Modern Developer Personas
This repository contains a collection of draft developer personas that can be used by Developer Relations professionals, regardless of the company that they work at and portion of the global developer population that they target.

They were built out using the [DevRel Foundation working group requirements and use case list](https://github.com/DevRel-Foundation/wg-resource-aggregation/discussions/46), which carried the following requirements:
1. Outcome-focused - They can be used to inform and guide DevRel strategies and tactics
2. Motivations - They include both technical and emotional aspects of developers
3. Practical - They incorporate industry-standard dimensions for practical use
4. Use cases - Each persona can drive content creation, event planning, community building, and product feedback
5. FLEXIBLE - They remain flexible enough to be adapted for specific contexts

The personas include standard dimensions such as motivations, technical preferences, challenges, communication preferences, and learning styles to enable consistent application across organizations.


# Personas
There are five initial personas proposed below. The personas are intended to be technology/industry agnostic, applying a motivational lens across all modern developers.

To help communicate how each of these personas can be used by DevRel, each row has a set of activities that DevRel can use if that persona is identified as a business target.
